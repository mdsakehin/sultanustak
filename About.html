    <p align="justify"> <p align="justify"> The Geolocation API is an effort by the World Wide Web Consortium to standardize an interface to retrieve the geographical location information for a client-side device.[3] It defines a set of objects, ECMAScript standard compliant, that executing in the client application give the client's device location through the consulting of Location Information Servers, which are transparent for the application programming interface (API). The most common sources of location information are IP address, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth MAC address, radio-frequency identification (RFID), Wi-Fi connection location, or device Global Positioning System (GPS) and GSM/CDMA cell IDs. The location is returned with a given accuracy depending on the best location information source available.

GPS (Global Positioning System)
This happens for any device which has GPS capabilities. A smartphone with GPS capabilities and set to high accuracy mode will be likely to obtain the location data from this. GPS calculate location information from the satellite signal. It has the highest accuracy; in most Android smartphones, the accuracy can be up to 10 metres.

        Mobile Network Location
Mobile phone tracking is used if a cellphone or wireless modem is used without a GPS chip built in.

Wi-Fi Positioning System
<p align="justify"> 
If Wi-Fi is used indoors, a Wi-Fi positioning system is the likeliest source. Some Wi-Fi spots have location services capabilities.</p>
<p align="justify"> 
IP Address Location
Location is detected based on the nearest public IP address on a device (which can be a computer, the router it is connected to, or the Internet Service Provider (ISP) the router uses). The location depends on the IP information available, but in many cases where the IP is hidden behind an ISP network address translation, the accuracy is only to the level of a city, region or even country.
p align="justify"> <p align="justify"> If an end user grants permission, the Geolocation API:

    Provides location data as latitude, longitude, altitude, speed, and heading, as well as the accuracy of the acquired location data, and the approximate time for when the position was acquired via the GeolocationPosition interface.
    Supports "one-shot" position updates via the getCurrentPosition() method and the ability to receive updates for when the position of the hosting device significantly changes via the watchPosition() method.
    Using the PositionOptions's maximumAge, allows an application to request a cached position whose age is no greater than a specified value (only the last position is cached).
    Provides a way for the application to receive updates about errors, as a GeolocationPositionError, that have occurred while acquiring a position.
    And through enableHighAccuracy, supports requesting "high accuracy" position data, though the request can be ignored by the user agent.
